I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Yale University. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

My research interests are mainly in machine learning and data mining. Recently, I have been working on the following topics, including 
- Hyperbolic Geometry
- Representation Learning
- Transformers
- Large Language Models
- AI for Drug Discovery (AI4Drug)
- Recommender Systems

Please feel free to contact me if you have anything to discuss.
