### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Menglin Yang

---

I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, working with Prof. Rex Ying. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Irwin King.

My research interests are mainly in the fields of machine learning and data mining. Recently, I have been working on the following topics, including 
- Hyperbolic Geometry
- Representation Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Large Language Models
- AI for Drug Discovery (AI4Drug).

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have anything to discuss.

Besides, I am organizing a hyperbolic paper reading group per week on Zoom. Feel free to contact me if you would like to join, share, and discuss.
You can find the hyperbolic learning groups at Slack: https://join.slack.com/t/hyperboliclearning/shared_invite/zt-1qcqgtwfr-HpsRSzDhvkAEal6dOnKDvA
