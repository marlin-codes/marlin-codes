### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Menglin Yang.

I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at Yale University, working with Prof. Rex Ying. Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Irwin King.

My research interests are mainly in the fields of machine learning and data mining. Recently, I concentrated on several key areas, including 
- Hyperbolic Geometry
- Representation Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Large Language Models
- AI for Drug Discovery (AI4Drug).

Feel free to contact me if you have anything to talk with me.

Besides, I am organizing a hyperbolic paper reading group per week on Zoom. Feel free to contact me if you would like to join, share, and discuss.
